# Heart Attack Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart attack based on various health-related factors. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques and utilizes a dataset of historical patient data. This README file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running and using the prediction model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of anonymized patient records containing information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and various other attributes. The dataset is not included in this repository and should be obtained separately. It should be in a CSV format with the necessary columns for training the prediction model.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the heart attack prediction model:

- Python (3.6+)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

You can install the necessary packages by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

To use the heart attack prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the dataset with patient records.
2. Place the dataset file (in CSV format) in the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
4. Train the model using the dataset (see [Model Training](#model-training)).
5. Perform predictions on new data (see [Prediction](#prediction)).
6. Evaluate the model's performance (see [Evaluation](#evaluation)).

## Model Training

To train the heart attack prediction model, you need to run the `train_model.py` script. Make sure you have the dataset file in the project directory before proceeding. Run the following command:

```
python train_model.py --dataset <dataset_filename> --model <model_filename>
```

Replace `<dataset_filename>` with the name of your dataset file and `<model_filename>` with the desired filename to save the trained model. The script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it to the specified file.

## Prediction

To predict the likelihood of a heart attack for a new set of data, you can use the trained model obtained from the previous step. Run the `predict.py` script and provide the required input values. Run the following command:

```
python predict.py --model <model_filename> --input <input_values>
```

Replace `<model_filename>` with the filename of the trained model. `<input_values>` should be a comma-separated list of input values for the prediction, following the same order as the columns in the dataset.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the heart attack prediction model, you can use the `evaluate_model.py` script. Run the following command:

```
python evaluate_model.py --model <model_filename> --dataset <dataset_filename>
```

Replace `<model_filename>` with the filename of the trained model and `<dataset_filename>` with the name of the dataset file. The script will load the model and evaluate its performance using the provided dataset.
